desc = '''NaiveNN (naive neural networks) is a course project by
badpoet (Zhang Xunkai / Chang Hsun-kai).

In this project, I present a basic multi layer perceptron and a
convolutional neural network. They are employed to solve the CIFAR-10
dataset.

This project is well divided and packaged. Thus, it could be used for
other scientific calculation.
